# Home-Automation
This project propose a smart techniques  that can forecast day-ahead values of Grid Price
and Solar Generation and reschedule home appliances to maximize usage of solar energy and
minimize power bills. This helps shift the heavy energy load from peak hours to nonpeak
hours. Here, we do predictive analysis to forecast day-ahead electricity prices based
on ARIMA models. The historical and usually ill-behaved price series is decomposed using
the wavelet transform in a set of better-behaved constitutive series. Then, the future values of
these constitutive series are forecast using properly fitted ARIMA models. Once the
consumer is aware of the day-ahead grid prices and solar energy, we can
reschedule heavy and non-critical loads to non peak hours. In addition to rescheduling, a web
application is developed to control loads remotely. Main objective of this project is to
establish a smart home environment using open source technologies.
